# midi-remapper

A free online app that allows you to remap MIDI notes.

I personally frequently use this to remap General MIDI (GM) drum mapping to GetGood Drums (GGD) mapping.

You can request for presets if you happen to land on this project and need it.

Presets are not required. You can manually remap to the correct notes yourself.

# Setup

As simple as installing the project and running it.

```bash
bun install

bun run dev
```
